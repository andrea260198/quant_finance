# Quantitative Finance


## Description

This repo contains some example of quantitative finance projects based on what I learned at EPFL during the Master in Financial Engineering (MFE).


## Static type check

A static type check is performed on every **.py** file using **mypy**.
To perform the static type check run _static\_type\_check.sh_ script.


## Multiprocessing

Note that **multiprocessing** module is used to make full use of multi-core CPUs.
